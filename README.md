openfl-webview

Native Webview extension for OpenFL

This is a simple webview extension that pops up a WebView on iOS and Android outputs of OpenFL / Lime.

Main Features:
=======
* The popup has a close button on the top-left corner.
* Allows you to set onClose and onURLChanging events.
* It allows the code to specify a list of valid URLs to browse. If the webview tries to access an invalid URL, it'll automatically close.
* On non-supported platforms, this extensions has no effect (makes nothing).

=======

```haxe
// This example show a simple sharing of a text using the Share Classs.

import extension.webview.WebView;

class SimpleExample {
	function new(){
		WebView.onClose=onClose;
		WebView.onURLChanging=onURLChanging;
	}

	function onClose(){
		trace("CLOSE!");
	}

	function onURLChanging(url:String){
		trace("WebView is about to open: "+url);
	}

	function shareStuff(){
		WebView.open('http://www.puralax.com/help',true);
	}
}
